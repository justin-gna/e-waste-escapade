# E-Waste Escapade

I created this project in April of 2021 for my ICS4U (Grade 12 Introduction to Computer Science) culminating project.
The goal of the project was to utilize our knowledge to create a python program that could help raise awareness about E-Waste.

I used object oriented programming to create a maze game that is played entirely in the console.
Also, I researched how to use Google Maps Platform API and familiarized myself with the [googlemaps python library](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python) to implement an E-Waste recycling centre locator. 

you can play E-Waste Escapade by cloning this repository and setting up a python virtual environment with the required packages (googlemaps, blessed, time)
you also need to set up your own Google Maps API Key through https://mapsplatform.google.com/lp/maps-apis/ and put it in a file called `api_key.txt` in the directory you cloned this repo to.
If you are unsure about this process, just contact me through LinkedIn.
