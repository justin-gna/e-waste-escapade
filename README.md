# E-Waste Escapade

I created this project in April of 2021 for my ICS4U (Grade 12 Introduction to Computer Science) culminating project.

The goal of the project was to utilize our knowledge to create a python program that could help raise awareness about e-waste.

I implemented object oriented programming to create a maze game that is played entirely in the console.

Also, I researched how to use an API key and familiarized myself with the googlemaps python library to implement an E-waste recycling centre locator.
