# E-Waste Escapade

I created this project in April of 2021 for my ICS4U (Grade 12 Introduction to Computer Science) culminating project.
The goal of the project was to utilize our knowledge to create a python program that could help raise awareness about E-Waste.

I used object oriented programming to create a maze game that is played entirely in the console.
Also, I researched how to use Google Maps Platform API and familiarized myself with the [googlemaps python library](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python) to implement an E-Waste recycling centre locator.
